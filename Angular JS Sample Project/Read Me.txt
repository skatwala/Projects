 
Angular JS Sample Project 

	This project illustrates an Angular JS application.  

	This is a Single Page Application that consumes REST Services.  It uses the following Angular JS concepts
			
		1	MVC implementation in Angular JS
		2	Routes
		3	Data and Event Binding
		4	Dividing App into Partials
		5	Template Views
		6	Angular Animation
		
		This application can run locally in FireFox.  Download the "Angular JS Sample Project" and launch the index.html in FireFox
		
		Chrome and IE implement the same domain policy and hence will require the built in REST Service along with this project running on a Web Server such as IIS, nGINX, Apache, Node JS, etc
