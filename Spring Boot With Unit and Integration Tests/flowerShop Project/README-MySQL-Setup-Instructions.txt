Be sure you have installed a MySQL Community Edition Server, and that you have done the following:

	1. The database server is up and running on port 3306
	2. There is a scheme named:  "spring-tdd"
	3. There is a user with proper privileges granted to the "spring-tdd" scheme. user id - root, password Welcome1

Finally, modify the application.properties files to have the correct database connection URL with accurate schema name and port number; plus correct username and password values too, e.g.:

	spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spring-tdd
	spring.datasource.username = root	
	spring.datasource.password = Welcome1
